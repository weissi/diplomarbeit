This writing describes the process of securely evaluating arithmetic functions
such as $f(x_G,x_D) = ...$ over finite fields.  As the main building block
OAFEs---as provided by the David \& Goliath protocol \cite{davidgoliath}---are
used. However, the first step is to securely express the input function $f(x_G,
x_D)$ in terms of affine functions. These affine functions can then be securely
evaluated using OAFEs. At a first glance, the task of expressing a general
function $f(x_G, x_D)$ using affine functions may seem a rather easy task. The
challenge is to do it securely: The other party should obviously not be able to
learn $G$ when it is given the linear functions expressing the partly evaluated
function $f(G, x_D)$ (value $G$ already set).  Additionally, the process should
work non--interactively: The first party fixes its input $x_G = G$, partly
evaluates $f(G, x_D)$, transforms it to affine functions and sends them as OAFEs
to the second party. The affine functions themselves are either a constant or
hidden inside an OAFE calculation. After the second party provided their input
$x_D$ to the OAFEs, it gets (from the OAFEs) the evaluated results of the linear
functions. The second party is now---using a provided decoder---able to securely
and fully evaluate $f(x_G, x_D)$ using only the values received from the OAFEs
and the constants. Neither party will learn more of the other party's input than
the final result will tell it anyway.
