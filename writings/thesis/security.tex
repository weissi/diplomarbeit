\JWlone{Correctness and Security of the Protocol}
\label{sec:security}

This chapter proofs the UC \cite{canetti05} security of the protocol described
in chapter \ref{sec:protocol}. Informally, the goal is to proof that for every
adversary $\mathcal{A}$ there has to exist a simulator $\mathcal{S}$ such that
for all environments $\mathcal{Z}$ the ideal functionality is indistinguishable
from the real protocol. Formally this can be represented as

\begin{align*}
%
\forall \mathcal{A}\ \exists \mathcal{S}\ \forall \mathcal{Z} :
\text{ideal}\ \widetilde{=}\ \text{real}
%
\end{align*}

% SIMULATOR S_DAVID(A)
\JWlthree{Simulator $\mathcal{S}_{\text{\JWpTwo{}}}(\mathcal{A})$}
\label{sec:simulator-david}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Setup emulated honest \JWpTwo{}

  \item Feed emulated honest \JWpTwo{} with the same inputs the corrupted
    \JWpTwo{} receives

  \item Compare the outputs of the emulated, honest \JWpTwo{} with the corrupted
    one

  \item Should the corrupted \JWpTwo{} behave different than the emulated
    \JWpTwo{}, return uniform randomness as the final output to the environment

  \item Should the corrupted \JWpTwo{} behave honestly, pass it's input to the
    ideal functionality and output the return value to the environment

\end{itemize}


% SIMULATOR S_Goliath(A)
\JWlthree{Simulator $\mathcal{S}_{\text{Goliath}}(\mathcal{A})$}
\label{sec:simulator-goliath}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Setup an emulated, honest \JWpOne{}

  \item Feed the emulated \JWpOne{} with the same inputs the corrupted \JWpOne{}
    receives

  \item

\end{itemize}

% PROOF

\label{sec:proof}

The proof is a case distinction.


% CORRECTNESS --- BOTH PARTIES HONEST
\JWlthree{Correctness --- Both Parties Honest}

Easy, just works.



% BOTH PARTIES CORRUPTED
\JWlthree{Both Parties Corrupted}

The case that both parties are corrupted is just an hypothetical case in the UC
model.


% CORRUPTED DAVID
\JWlthree{Corrupted \JWpTwo{}}

Use the simulator from chapter \ref{sec:simulator-david}. Perfectly secure.


% CORRUPTED GOLIATH
\JWlthree{Corrupted \JWpOne{}}

Use the simulator from chapter \ref{sec:simulator-goliath}. Perfectly secure.
