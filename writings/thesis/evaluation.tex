This part evaluates the computational complexity of the methodology and the
performance of the implementation. Additionally, this thesis' contribution and
the open questions are exposed in the following.

\JWlthree{Test Machines}
\label{sec:test-machines}

Both test machines are regular home computer systems, thus the benchmarks were
not run under laboratory conditions, Though most background services and other
programs that could interfere with the benchmarks have been stopped. The
implementation has been compiled using full optimizations turned on
(\JWcmd{cabal configure --ghc-options=-O3}). To work out the computing time
taken for the implementation of the protocol itself, the protocol implementation
is evaluated using two different finite field implementations.
The first implementation is a C++ library (see Section
\ref{sec:finite-field-calcs}) for calculation in $\mathbb{F}_{2^{256}}$ and the
second implementation is a \JWThaskell{} library which calculates in the prime
field $\mathbb{F}_{97}$.


\JWlfour*{Test Machine 1}

\emph{Dell Latitude D620} running \emph{Debian GNU/Linux} on kernel version
\emph{3.1.7, 32--bit}. The machine is powered by a \emph{Intel\TReg{} Core Duo
T2400} dual core processor at \emph{1.83 GHz}. It has \emph{2 GB} of system
memory.


\JWlfour*{Test Machine 2}

\emph{Apple Mac mini} (\texttt{Macmini 3,1}) running \emph{MacOS X 10.7.5
(Lion), 64--bit}. The machine is powered by a \emph{Intel\TReg{} Core 2 Duo}
dual core processor at \emph{2.26 GHz}. It has \emph{8 GB} of system memory.

\JWlthree{Benchmarking Process}

Both machines run the three programs (\JWBpOne{}, \JWBpTwo{}, \JWBtoken{})
simultaneously, the programs are compiled single--threaded. They
communicate with each other using local TCP/IP networking. Section
\ref{sec:communication-channels} has an in--depth description about the
communication that takes part in the implementation that comes with this thesis.
The running time includes the DRAC building and transmitting, the OAFE
configuration and the successful evaluation of a random polynomial. The
polynomial is evaluated using \emph{Horner's rule} \cite{cormen01}. The data
points in all figures and tables were obtained by taking the median of
running the same benchmark five times in a row (preceded by a non--accounted
warm--up run).

% COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY
%
\JWltwo{Computational Complexity}
\label{sec:comp-complexity}

Ordinary evaluation of a polynomial of degree $n$ using \emph{Horner's rule} is
in $\Theta(n)$ \cite{cormen01}. Despite the complex technique presented in this
thesis the overall evaluation time is still in $\Theta(n)$. This is true for
both, the theoretical examination and the implementation. Figure
\ref{fig:poly-deg-t} and Table \ref{tab:poly-deg-t} show this for the finite
field $\mathbb{F}_{97}$ (implementation from the \JWTLhaskellForMaths{}
package). The implementation for the field $\mathbb{F}_{2^{256}}$ does not seem
to have linear time complexity. This is caused by the suboptimal implementation
and the Haskell binding of the library used for the calculations in
$\mathbb{F}_{2^{256}}$. It is problematic that the library includes a rather
complex routine for object destruction that takes most of the evaluation time.
Root of the problem is that functional languages prefer immutable (unchangeable)
objects with very fast construction/destruction and the C++ library that is
interfaced is optimized for as few constructions/destructions as possible and
the use of mutable objects. The phenomenon that is observable when using this
library is that the garbage collector is taking up most of the running time (up
to $85\%$) waiting for the library destruction routine. For high performance
(such as the pure Haskell implementation for $\mathbb{F}_{97}$) another library
should be interfaced or developed entirely in Haskell, but this is not the main
concern of this thesis. Further details are covered in Section
\ref{sec:finite-field-calcs}. For lower degrees, the current implementation for
$\mathbb{F}_{2^{256}}$ has linear time complexity. Figure
\ref{fig:poly-deg-t-small} and Table \ref{tab:poly-deg-t-small} show this. It is
also noteworthy that the first test machine (see Section
\ref{sec:test-machines}) outperforms the second test machine despite the
inferior hardware. The cause has not been investigated, but a possible cause
could be that the 64--bit \JWTghc{} runtime seems to be slower (at least on
Apple Macs) \cite{lentczner11}.

% MEMORY COMPLEXITY

\JWltwo{Memory Complexity}
\label{sec:mem-complexity}

The memory complexity of the current implementation is in $O(n)$, $n$ being the
polynomial's degree, too. The reason is that the implementation has to store all
DRAEs to be able to generate the OAFE configuration and to write the OAFE
references in the DRAEs.
